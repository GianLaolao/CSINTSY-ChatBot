How to Run ChatBot (Group 6)


1. Open chatBot.py and run.
2. Enter a prompt to either give a statement to add to the knowledge base or enter a question to query the chatbot.
3. In entering your prompt, make sure to include a period (.) or a queston mark (?) in order for the bot to determine the type of prompt.
	ex. Alice and Bob are siblings.
4. Make sure the syntax is correct and no unnecessary symbols.
5. After entering your prompt, press Enter and wait for the ChatBot's response.
6. The ChatBot will then return a response based on your prompt.
7. If there are errors in the prompt, it will return an error message or the program will terminate.
8. To exit the program, type "exit"
